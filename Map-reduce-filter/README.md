# Array Methods: Map, Reduce, and Filter

Map, reduce, and filter are probably the three most important array methods. They can be used to follow an appropriate functional programming style (substituting loops etc.). This is a short reminder of what you learnt in the lectures:

1. **`Array.prototype.map`:**  It executes that function on every element within it, returning a new array with all of the values that the function returned. It can take up to three parameters in this order: current item (value), index, entire array.

    ``` javascript
    const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const newArray = originalArray.map(function (element) {
        return element + 1
    });

    // Expected value of newArray = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

1. **`Array.prototype.reduce`:** This method reduces the array into a single value by passing on a function to carry out. It can pass up to four parameters in this order: `array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)`
1. **`Array.prototype.filter`:** Filtering decreases the size of the array to remove elements that are not needed. The syntax is:
     `array.filter(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)`

## Tutorial Questions

Before starting the actual tutorial questions you are going to need to

For this first set of questions we are going to be creating some functions to deal with colors, specifically arrays in the from [rrr, ggg, bbb] - RGB color codes.

1. **`Color.noRed`:** Under the even numbers function, create a function that takes in an arbitrary array of rgb colors and returns colors with no red in them.
1. **`Color.rgbToHexColor`:** Given an array of three elements with values from 0 to 255, return this rgb to a hex color code in the form `#rrggbb`
1. **`Color.mixColors`:** Givern two RGB array values, return an array that would combine both the colors (you might need to do a bit of research on color theory!)

For the next set of exercises go to the file matrix.js (these functions you are going to create might will definetely help you later as modules):

1. **`Matrix.multiply`:** Given a matrix and some integer 'n', multiply each of its elements by n.
1. **`Matrix.flatten`:** Given a matrix, generate a flattened version.
1. **`Matrix.generate`:** Given a single array and the dimensions of a matrix (in the form ("3,2"), generate the matrix.
1. **`Matrix.flipHorizontal`:** Given a matrix, generate a flattened version.
1. **`Matrix.singleDigitFilter`:** Given an arbitrary matrix filled with numbers, filter each row so that only one digit numbers can be displayed.
1. **`Matrix.findDeterminant`:** Given an arbitrary matrix filled with mumbers, find its determinant and return it.
1. **`Matrix.sumMatrices`:** Given two arbitrary matrices filled with numbers, find their sum.
1. **`Matrix.transpose`:** Given an arbitrary matrix, return its transposed version.
